# Seahorse

Seahorse is a Chrome extension that removes all gendered content and replaces it with gender neutral words / images to eliminate any biases in the/she  hiring process.

Companies can use this extension when screening applicants to make sure that there are no inherent biases in their hiring process, and to make sure that they are hiring diverse employees. 

## Usage
Clone the repository. On the Chrome extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`), toggle Developer mode on and load unpacked extension by selecting the repository folder. The extension is automatically active on every page, and can be toggled on and off on the Chrome extensions page.

## Future Improvements
* Better custom design for Github and LinkedIn could make the tool highly effective
* Image blocking for scroll is useful on LinkedIn
* Word replacement can be more elegant with gender neutral pronouns and their associated conjugation changes
